# Buttplug Valley
## A [Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) mod for Stardew Valley

I originally made this mod for my partner after discovering the lack of a buttplug stardew mod, but I figured I'd make it public. This mod allows you to connect your Buttplug.io compatible toys to Stardew Valley. It's a very simple mod, but it works.

## Installation and Setup
1. Install [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/)
   - This is what the mod uses to communicate with your toys.
2. Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
3. Install the [Buttplug Valley Mod](https://github.com/DryIcedTea/Buttplug-Valley/releases) and place it in your Stardew Valley Mods folder.

## Feedback
If you have any feedback, feel free to open an issue or contact me on discord. You'll find me in the buttplug.io discord!
I honestly don't know what I'm doing, so feedback is **very** much appreciated.

(If you want to help me make this mod better, that would be amazing and very much appreciated! This is very much a hobby project, so I don't know how often updates will come out. Apologies in advance for the bad code.)

## Special thanks
