# Buttplug Valley
## A Buttplug.io mod for Stardew Valley

I originally made this mod for my partner after discovering the lack of a buttplug stardew mod, but I figured I'd make it public. This mod allows you to connect your Buttplug.io compatible toys to Stardew Valley. It's a very simple mod, but it works.

## Installation and Setup
1. Install [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/)
   - This is what the mod uses to communicate with your toys.
2. Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
3. Install the Buttplug Valley Mod and place it in your Stardew Valley Mods folder.

I honestly don't know what I'm doing, so feedback is **very** much appreciated. (please)
